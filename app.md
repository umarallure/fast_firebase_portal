# Application Structure and Context

This document provides a detailed overview of the application's structure, key components, and their functionalities based on the provided file system layout and code snippets.

## 1. Directory Structure

The application follows a modular structure, organizing different concerns into dedicated directories:

```
├── api/              # Contains API endpoint definitions (e.g., automation routes)
├── auth/             # Handles authentication logic (e.g., Firebase integration)
├── config.py         # Application-wide configuration settings
├── main.py           # Main FastAPI application entry point and route definitions
├── models/           # Data models (e.g., Pydantic schemas, database models)
├── services/         # Business logic and service-layer functions (e.g., API interactions, data processing)
├── static/           # Static assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images
├── templates/        # Jinja2 HTML templates for rendering web pages
└── __pycache__/      # Python bytecode cache (automatically generated)
```

## 2. Core Components Analysis

### 2.1. `app/config.py`

This file defines the application's settings using `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`, which allows for configuration via environment variables and a `.env` file.

**Key Settings:**

*   `firebase_project_id`, `firebase_private_key`, `firebase_client_email`: Credentials for Firebase authentication.
*   `ghl_api_timeout`: Timeout in seconds for requests made to the GoHighLevel (GHL) API.
*   `max_concurrent_requests`: A setting for maximum concurrent requests, though its direct application for concurrency control isn't explicitly shown in `main.py`.
*   `subaccounts`: A JSON string that is parsed into a list of subaccount dictionaries via the `subaccounts_list` property. Each subaccount likely contains an `id` and `api_key` for GHL API access.

**Configuration Loading:**

*   The `Config` class specifies `env_file = ".env"`, meaning settings are loaded from a `.env` file in the application root.
*   `extra = "allow"` permits additional environment variables not explicitly defined in the `Settings` class.

### 2.2. `app/main.py`

This is the main entry point for the FastAPI application, responsible for setting up the web server, defining routes, configuring middleware, and serving static and dynamic content.

**Key Features and Functionalities:**

*   **FastAPI Initialization:** `app = FastAPI()` creates the core application instance.
*   **Static Files:** Mounts the `app/static` directory to `/static`, serving static assets like JavaScript (`app/static/js/main.js`, `app/static/js/auth-protect.js`).
*   **Templating:** Configures `Jinja2Templates` to render HTML files from the `app/templates` directory.
*   **CORS Middleware:** `CORSMiddleware` is configured with `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_credentials=True`, `allow_methods=["*"]`, and `allow_headers=["*"]`, indicating a very permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy.
*   **Router Inclusion:**
    *   `app.include_router(automation_router, prefix="/api/v1")`: Integrates API routes defined in `app/api/automation.py` under the `/api/v1` prefix. This suggests that the core business logic for automation is separated into its own module.
*   **Web Routes (HTML Pages):**
    *   `/` (GET): Renders `index.html`. This is likely the main landing page.
    *   `/dashboard` (GET): Renders `dashboard.html`.
    *   `/login` (GET): Renders `login.html`.
    *   `/bulk-update-notes` (GET): Renders `bulk_update_notes.html`, providing a UI for the bulk update feature.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/health` (GET): A simple health check endpoint returning `{"status": "ok"}`.
    *   `/api/subaccounts` (GET): Returns the list of configured subaccounts from `settings.subaccounts_list` as a JSON response.
    *   `/api/subaccounts/{sub_id}/pipelines` (GET):
        *   Fetches pipelines for a specific subaccount from the GoHighLevel API.
        *   Retrieves the `api_key` for the given `sub_id` from the application settings.
        *   Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous HTTP requests to the GHL API.
        *   Includes error handling and logging for failed API calls, returning an empty list on error.
    *   `/api/bulk-update-notes` (POST):
        *   Handles CSV file uploads for bulk updating notes on contacts in GoHighLevel.
        *   Parses the uploaded CSV, expecting columns like 'Contact ID', 'Notes', and 'Account Id'.
        *   Iterates through each row, constructs the GHL API request payload, and sends a POST request to the `/v1/contacts/{contact_id}/notes/` endpoint.
        *   Manages API keys per subaccount.
        *   Skips entries with missing data or empty notes.
        *   Aggregates success and error messages, returning a summary to the client.

## 3. Application Flow and Interactions

The application serves as a portal for managing GoHighLevel (GHL) subaccounts, providing both a web interface and API functionalities.

**User Flow (Web):**

1.  Users can access the root (`/`), dashboard (`/dashboard`), login (`/login`), and bulk update notes (`/bulk-update-notes`) pages, which are rendered using Jinja2 templates.
2.  Client-side JavaScript (e.g., `auth-protect.js`, `main.js`) likely handles client-side logic, including login checks and interactions with the `/api` endpoints.

**API Flow:**

1.  **Configuration:** The `config.py` file loads essential settings, including Firebase credentials and GoHighLevel subaccount API keys.
2.  **Authentication:** The import of `app.auth.firebase.get_current_user` suggests that API routes (especially those under `/api/v1` via `automation_router`) are protected using Firebase authentication.
3.  **GoHighLevel Integration:**
    *   The `/api/subaccounts/{sub_id}/pipelines` endpoint demonstrates fetching data from GHL.
    *   The `/api/bulk-update-notes` endpoint showcases writing data (notes) to GHL in a batch process.
    *   The application uses `httpx` for asynchronous communication with the GHL REST API.

**Data Flow (Bulk Update Notes):**

```

## 5. Dependencies (Inferred)

Based on the imports and functionalities, the application relies on:

*   **FastAPI:** For building the web API and serving web pages.
*   **Uvicorn (or similar ASGI server):** To run the FastAPI application.
*   **Pydantic/Pydantic-Settings:** For configuration management and data validation.
*   **Jinja2:** For server-side HTML templating.
*   **Httpx:** For making asynchronous HTTP requests to external APIs (specifically GoHighLevel).
*   **Firebase Admin SDK (implied by `app.auth.firebase`):** For Firebase authentication.
*   **CSV module:** For parsing CSV files.
*   **Pathlib:** For path manipulation.

## 5. Potential Enhancements/Considerations

*   **Error Handling:** While some error logging is present, a more robust global error handling strategy (e.g., custom exception handlers) could be beneficial.
*   **Authentication:** The `get_current_user` import suggests authentication, but its application to specific routes isn't shown in `main.py` (though it's likely applied to `automation_router`).
*   **Concurrency Control:** The `max_concurrent_requests` setting is present but not explicitly used in `main.py` for limiting concurrent GHL API calls, which could be important for rate limiting.
*   **Security:** The permissive CORS settings (`allow_origins=["*"]`) should be reviewed and restricted to known origins in a production environment.
*   **Logging:** Basic logging is used, but a more comprehensive logging setup (e.g., structured logging, log rotation) would be beneficial for production.
