# Opportunity Migration Environment Variables Example
# Add these to your .env file

# Opportunity Migration Tag - Custom tag to add to migrated opportunities for identification
OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TAG=migrated-opportunity

# Test Mode - Set to 5 for testing, 0 for production (no limit)
OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TEST_LIMIT=5

# Example configurations:

# For testing with 5 opportunities:
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TAG=test-migration
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TEST_LIMIT=5

# For production (migrate all opportunities):
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TAG=migrated-from-child
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TEST_LIMIT=0

# For specific client migration:
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TAG=migrated-arktech
# OPPORTUNITY_MIGRATION_TEST_LIMIT=10

# These settings work alongside the existing contact migration settings:
# CONTACT_MIGRATION_TAG=masterarktech
# CONTACT_MIGRATION_TEST_LIMIT=5

# Important Notes:
# 1. Contact migration must be completed first (Phase 1) before running opportunity migration
# 2. The opportunity migration will look for a "contact_mapping.json" file created during contact migration
# 3. Pipeline and stage mapping is done automatically using smart similarity matching (60%+ threshold)
# 4. Test mode allows safe validation before processing all opportunities
# 5. All migrated opportunities will have the specified tag for easy identification
